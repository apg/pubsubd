#+Title: Pubsubd Readme

* Pubsubd, a publish-subscribe system for Combosaurus

Pubsubd was the second iteration of the pubsub system that we
used, mostly, for cache invalidation in Combosaurus across the
lot of services we had.

The [original design](ORIGINAL.DESIGN.org), was considered to
be ideal, but not practical, and I implemented a different 
strategy. 

Rather than the client exposing a server, the client essentially
opened up a long lived TCP connection to pubsubd, gave it's 
subscription id, and recieved MsgPack data representing published
messages, or Pings.

This was written in 2012.

* Installation

This code will *not* compile, as it is missing some important parts
that are not open. However, it's the 2nd Go program I ever wrote,
and I was quite happy with it. No idea how I'd rate it today. :)
